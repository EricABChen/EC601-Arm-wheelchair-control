Voice control	part
  Voice control: Alexa Skills Kit is a Voice User Interface which provides built-in deep learning model. As developer, we create a
new interaction module by defining intents and fill in utterances and slots which represent the oral instruction that the user might    provide. The Alexa Skills Kit then do the deep learning automatically and generate some possible similar syntax, so when the user         actually
interact with the module, it would be more flexible and improve the users experience.

MATLAB Computer Vision Part
  1. First we need upload a picture to our code system.
  2. Second our code will start process it. It will begin from using MSERfunction to detect text region -> Remove  non-text region -> Mark text content.
  3. When our code finished, we will show all of step of our processing step. And give the final result of mark picture text content.
  4. In this project, we use MATLAB function to calculate our regions and mark text content. In our code, do not have so much data.

Python Computer Vision part:
  1. The code was first developed and tested using elevator images from the internet. 
  2. The code was then tested on elevator images from pictures collected by the team.
  3. We then fed videos of elevators, recorded by the team to develop and test the code.
  4. The video was taken in two different environments:
      Metal Lift
      Wooden Lift
