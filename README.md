EC601 arm wheel control

MATLAB part
In our project, we have finished sprint 2 part. In this part, you can see our code above. We used MATLAB to detect objects. It has two different part for our detection. The first part is using MATLAB code to detect object. In our code, we used MATLAB object detection tools to detect some simple object. When you finish run the ".m" file, you can see our detect target, it is a stop sign. Becuase our project is smart wheelchair, we need to detect handicap sign. In sprint 2, we just achieve some easy function that is why we detect stop sign.

Second, we want to use MATLAB open CV function to give us project some extra function which is lane detection. We want to make our wheelchair automatically drive itself. This function will help people who cannot drive wheelchair in a good way. In this part, we use lane detection function to show two lanes of road and we also add a midline to tell people your wheelchair is driving in a wrong way. At the same time, we add "bird's eye view" function to get a better view direction for our wheelchair.

Third, for using our code, you need to download two ".m" files which is lane detection code and another is object detection. Then you can directly run our code in your computer MATLAB program. You will get some pictures of object detection. And you will get a video of lane detection. In the video, the yellow line is midline. At the right up corner of this video, you will get a small window which is "bird's eye view". This two different view from a same camera.
